# LMS

A very basic Library Management System made with JSF and PrimeFaces.

## Running instructions
1. Create a MySQL database named ‘drrsdbs’. Select ‘mysql.sys@localhost’.
2. Ensure that you have PrimeFaces 8.0 installed on your machine. If you are using NetBeans, ensure that you have PrimeFaces 8.0 added into your library. 
PrimeFaces 8.0 can be installed from [here](https://www.primefaces.org/downloads/).
3. ```Clean and Build``` the project, and proceed to ```Run```.
4. The LMS should show up on your default browser on ```localhost:8080/LMS-war/```.
